# intro_to_R
This github is intended to introduce folks (primarily SULIs) to the tools and coding we utilize in most of our projects. This repository is intended to be stand-alone, so only uses embedded datasets. 

NOTE: codes are all written on a Mac, and may have issues on a Windows computer! If you run into issues, please let me know!
