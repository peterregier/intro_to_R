# intro_to_R
This github is intended to introduce folks (primarily SULIs) to the tools and coding we utilize in most of our projects. This repository is intended to be stand-alone, so only uses embedded datasets. 

NOTE: codes are all written on a Mac, and may have issues on a Windows computer! If you run into issues, please let me know!

Prior to working with these codes, you'll need to do 4 things: 
1. Install R - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
2. Install RStudio - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
3. Create a Github account - https://github.com/join
4. Install Github Desktop - (unless you're a pro and refer terminal. I'm not, and use Desktop) - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop

All scripts are ordered, and located in the /scripts folder
